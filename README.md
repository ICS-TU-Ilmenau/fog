Forwarding on Gates
===================

**Forwarding on Gates** (FoG) is an architecture and a network protocol for a Future Internet, which is developed by the [Integrated Communication Systems group](http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/integrated-communication-systems-group/) of the [TU Ilmenau](http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/international/) (Germany). FoG combines connectionless and connection-oriented aspects in a single (inter-)network protocol. The architecture separates routing and data transfer. The FoG layer bases on a recursive layer model.

The simulator/emulator software for FoG is called **FoGSiEm**. It is an OSGi-based application, which can be started in command line or GUI mode. The GUI mode bases on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP). The core parts of FoGSiEm are available under a dual-license GPL 2.0/EPL. The GUI extensions are available under the EPL.
