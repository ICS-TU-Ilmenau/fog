	<h2>Basis/Dependencies</h2>
	
	<p>This software uses the BGP implementation of the <a href=www.ssfnet.org">Scalable Simulation Framework (SSF)</a> 2.0 (from 2004) as a basis.
	The implementation was adapted for FoG and, thus, uses different interfaces (e.g. for setting up connections).
	However, the internal BGP logic was not modified.
	The dependencies to software from Raceway have been removed.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, the BGP code depends on the <a href=www.jakarta.apache.org>Regexp project</a>, which is included as JAR.</p>
